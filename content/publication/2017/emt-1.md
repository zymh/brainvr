title = "Episodic-like memory tested in virtual environment"

abstract = "Episodic memory is a neurocognitive system – an ability to recall unique past events based on knowledge of "what", "when" and "where". These three parameters describe an individual characteristic of the event and form a model of episodic like memory (ELM) ), which is often tested also in animals. To study the ELM concept in humans, we designed in our pilot experiment the ELM task in two virtual environments and tested them in healthy volunteers."
